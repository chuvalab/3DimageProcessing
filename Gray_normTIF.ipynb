    "# Grayscale and normalize images\n",
    "This notebook converts images from input folder to grayscale and normalizes intensity, shipping them to an output folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper, this notebook was used as the step between FIJI and Adobe Photoshop for cross section images. The workflow was as follows: \n",
    "- FIJI: Use BioImporter to select the 3D .ims file of an rhTestis. \n",
    "- FIJI: Select a single Z slice to obtain a cross section view. \n",
    "- FIJI: Save the Z slice as separate .tiff files per channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Then, go to this notebook. Here, the .tiff files will be turned into grayscale images that will be normalized for minimum and maximum signal. The output .tiff files can then be parsed into Photoshop as one image. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of note: \n",
    "- In your directory where this .ipynb notebook is stored, please make a folder and name this \"RawImages\" -> put your .tif files in this \"Images\" folder. \n",
    "- Do not create an output folder, the code will do this. \n",
    "- This notebook will process all the images in your input folder. \n",
    "- The code assumes 16-bit images, but you may change this if needed in 'def normalize_data'.  \n"
